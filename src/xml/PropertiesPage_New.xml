This layer represents the results of that model with each color indicating an individual benthic habitat. This dataset is intended for use at the regional scale and may not be adequate for site specific decisions. Users should refer to the attached metadata and Chapter Three of the Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregional Assessment to better understand the methods, constraints and suggested uses of this information. Chapter Three can be viewed here.Benthic habitats are unique combinations of ecological marine units and their corresponding species assemblages, or groups of benthic species that are commonly found together. Ecological Marine Units or EMUs are unique combinations of physical characteristics (i.e. depth, sediment grain size, and seabed forms). Each of these physical characteristics is grouped according to thresholds established by significant statistical relationships to the species assemblages. The species assemblages are defined using data from benthic grab samples provided by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service. Depth is based on the 1998 Coastal Relief Model created by NOAA/NGDC that has been augmented with data from the NOS Bathymetric and Fish Maps and the USGS Gulf of Maine 15’ Bathymetry. The sediment grain size data is interpolated from a point dataset from USGS’s usSEABED. Seabed forms are comprised of the two-way combination of land position index and degree of slope. Both of these values are calculated based on the augmented Coastal Relief Model dataset. Additional information on each analysis can be found in Chapter Three of the Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregional Assessment."
